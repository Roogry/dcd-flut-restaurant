## Introduction

Restoeev is a Restaurant Application designed to provide restaurant recommendations, information about foods, drinks, and everything related to dining experiences.

The purpose of this project is to fulfill the requirements of the [Flutter Fundamental Course](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/195) offered by Dicoding. Utilizing the Provider State Management, I have developed this restaurant app. To explore the specific features I have implemented, please refer to the Features section.

In Submission 1, the main focus was on creating a user interface and fetching data from JSON. The features included a restaurant list, restaurant search, and restaurant details.
Submission 2 involved integrating a REST API using the [http package](https://pub.dev/packages/http).
Submission 3 centered around implementing the bookmark feature using Sqflite and integrating notifications with the alarm manager.
